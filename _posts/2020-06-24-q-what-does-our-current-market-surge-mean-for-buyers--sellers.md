The surge we’ve been predicting for months for our San Diego real estate market is here.

As we make our way through June, **San Diego is reopening, and there is a lot of activity and pent-up demand out there.** People who were planning on buying or selling three months ago but had to put their plans on hold have reentered the market, and they’ve joined the buyers and sellers who were already there.&nbsp;

Let’s once again turn our attention to the latest numbers (or leading indicators, as I call them) and see how last May’s statistics compare to May 2019:

* New listings dropped 25% from 5,039 to 3,737
* Pending homes dropped 7% from 3,268 to 3,015
* Total supply dropped 35% from 7,150 to 4,603
* The average days on market dropped 20% from 29 to 23 days
* The month’s supply of inventory dropped 37% from 2.7 to 1.7 months

It’s important to note the activity surrounding new listings and pending homes in this case because that represents the supply and demand. A 25% drop in new listings is significant, but the previous month saw a 40% decrease, so we’ve actually seen an improvement. The same goes for pending homes; the previous month saw a massive 41% decrease.&nbsp;

In other words, **far more buyers are entering the market than sellers.** If you’re a seller, this is good news because it means you can attract more showings, more offers, and sell quickly. Besides the urge to resume their real estate plans, another reason so many buyers are entering the market is low interest rates. Many lenders can offer rates lower than 3%, so if you’re thinking of buying, talk to your lender now. You may be able to afford more than you think, and we don’t know how long these low rates will last.&nbsp;

**The bottom line is, we’re back.** As with interest rates, though, we don’t know how long this state will last given the concerns of a second coronavirus wave. If you’re thinking of making a move, the time to do it is now.&nbsp;
