It’s mid-March, and a lot of wacky things have been happening since February with the coronavirus. Many people are asking what’s happening in the real estate market. We haven’t seen a large effect from the coronavirus in the market, at least not yet. At 0:25 in the video above, see all the numbers concerning our market.

Compared to March 2019, we’re down 5.1% in new listings. **Pending sales are up 21% compared to last year,** which is consistent with what we’ve been seeing lately. More homes have been coming off the market than being listed.&nbsp;

Our total supply of homes listed in the county is down 39%. Sellers should be taking advantage of the extremely low inventory right now; it won’t last forever. Compared to March 2019, the number of days on market has gone down by 15.4%. Houses are coming off the market faster and faster.&nbsp;

Here in San Diego we currently have 1.4 months’ supply of homes, which means we’d run out of houses to sell in about a month and a half if nothing else came onto the market. A well-balanced market in this county is three to six months of supply. The market is staying strong, and I’m interested to see how things will change over the next month. I believe our economy is secure, even though we’re seeing the stock market flounder a bit.

**I will be keeping you informed about how our real estate market is being affected** by the coronavirus so you can make the best decisions for you and your family.&nbsp;
