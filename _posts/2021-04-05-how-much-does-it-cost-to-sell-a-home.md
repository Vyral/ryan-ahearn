How much does it cost to sell a home? There is no black and white answer to this question. Everything is a gray area when it comes to closing costs because every situation is different. Today I want to go over some of the basic closing costs involved and an easy way to get a ballpark estimate of what these costs will run you.

{% include pullquote.html %}

Some of the most common closing costs include:

* Escrow fees
* Title fees
* HOA fees
* Payoff demands
* Reconveyance fees
* Wire fees
* Courier fees
* Recording fees

**Most of the time, your closing costs will add up to about 1% of the purchase price if you’re selling.** If you’re selling for $500,000 for example, you’ll want $5,000 set aside for closing costs. However, as I said, each situation is different.&nbsp;

If you’d like a net sheet for your particular house and your situation, I’m happy to provide that for you. Remember that these closing costs don’t include commission fees.&nbsp;

If you have questions about closing costs, commissions, or anything else related to real estate, don’t hesitate to reach out via phone or email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
