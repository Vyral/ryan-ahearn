<br>We are in August of 2019 and we’re in one heck of a confusing real estate market. All the market data is suggesting that we should be on fire, but we’re not. What’s going on?

The first leading indicator we look at when perusing the numbers is the number of homes that are hitting the market. **That number is down 7.7% from this time last year, while the number of homes coming off the market are up 14.9%.** Those are the biggest numbers that we’ve seen all year. Inventory is down a whopping 9.2% after being down only 3.2% last month.&nbsp;

**This means that our market should be on fire, right?** Wrong. That’s just not the case. If you put your home on the market and you're a little bit off on your price, it will just sit there.&nbsp;

This is because we’re facing an affordability challenge. **The number of people here in San Diego County that can afford a home goes down and down as prices go up.** Even though we have low inventory and we're seeing a lot of sales, we still don’t have a ton of buyers buying because of the prices.&nbsp;

Now let’s talk about what this means for you as a buyer. If you’re looking to purchase a San Diego County home now, **you can expect less competition, homes sitting on the market longer, and low interest rates that will save you money on your mortgage over time.&nbsp;**

We know that real estate prices will always go up, but interest rates are the only thing that can save or cost you a bunch of money over time depending on where they’re at today. **For the record, these are the lowest rates we’ve seen in a long time.**

If you’re a seller here in the area, know that you have a lot less competition on the market right now and all of our data suggests that prices will continue to climb as interest rates remain low.

If you have any questions for me about the current state of the market or about real estate in general, don’t hesitate to give us a call or send us an email. We’d be happy to help you out however we can.<br>&nbsp;
