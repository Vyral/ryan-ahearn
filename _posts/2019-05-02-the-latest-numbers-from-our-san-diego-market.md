What’s the latest news from our San Diego market as we move through the second quarter of 2019?

As always, there are five leading indicators we look at when answering this type of question: new listings, pending sales, inventory (i.e., the number of homes for sale), the average days on market, and the months of supply.&nbsp;

**In this case, we’ll see how the figures from April of this year compare to April 2018:&nbsp;**

* The number of new listings dropped 5.6%&nbsp;
* The number of pending sales rose 6.6%
* Inventory rose 7.5%—while this still qualifies as an increase, it’s a far cry from when it was increasing by as much as 40% in previous months&nbsp;
* The average days on market rose 29.6% to 35 days
* The month’s supply of inventory rose 15.8% to 2.2 months

What does this mean for buyers and sellers?&nbsp;

**There are fewer homes being listed and more being sold, which is good news for sellers.** However, we should also mention that interest rates have dropped recently, which helps both buyers and sellers. If you’re a buyer, you can buy a home for a more affordable monthly mortgage payment. If you’re a seller, lower interest rates mean more buyers out in the market.&nbsp;
