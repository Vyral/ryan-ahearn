  You’ve probably heard the saying that rules are made to be broken, and we at
  the Ryan Ahearn team certainly believe this is true when it comes to real
  estate. Today we’re going to highlight two real estate “rules” that aren’t
  actually rules at all, and explain why we break them for the sake of our
  clients’ success.

  By subverting these rules, we at the Ryan Ahearn Team are far better equipped
  to assist you, our clients, than we would be if we fell in line with the
  status quo.

Real estate is in many ways a “copycat” industry. What I mean by this is that while the barrier of entry is very low, actually succeeding as a real estate professional is a much steeper obstacle. So when **new agents are thrown into the fray, so to speak, they tend to look to those around them for guidance.** They then try to imitate what every other agent out there is doing.

However, it’s important to realize that just because you’ve seen other real estate professionals operating in a certain way, it doesn’t mean that their tactics are the best possible strategy. To illustrate what I mean, I’d like to share (and debunk) two supposed “rules” of real estate for you today. By subverting these rules, we at the Ryan Ahearn Team are far better equipped to assist you, our clients, than we would be if we fell in line with the status quo.

The first rule pertains to sellers. If you’ve ever tried to sell your home, your listing agent probably scheduled showings at 30-minute intervals—giving each buyer a distinct time slot during which they can browse through your property. To tell you the truth, it doesn’t have to be this way. **There is no set rule that says buyers must attend separate showings.**

Imagine, for a moment, how it might benefit you (as a seller) if your agent was to let all the buyers in at the same time. Wouldn’t it be better if buyers knew exactly how much competition they were up against? We certainly think so.

When a buyer views a home alone, they might think to themselves, “I love this property. What can I do to get a good deal on it?” When a buyer views a home alongside their competition, however, they stop thinking about what the seller can give to them and start thinking about what they can give to the seller.

The second rule pertains to buyers. While many agents out there might try to make it seem like the only available homes are those listed on the market, there’s no rule that says this has to be the case. **There are actually many off-market properties available**, and our team is always happy to put these homes on the map for our buyers. Many of these properties are truly hidden gems.
