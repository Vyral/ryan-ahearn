Our San Diego real estate market has been a mixed bag lately, so it’s time to get to the bottom of what exactly has been going on lately.&nbsp;

Excitingly, **this July was the best month our market has seen in over a year,** so let’s dive right in.

The number of new listings that came to our market this July is down 11.3% compared to what we saw last year, but the number of pending sales actually rose 3.5%. These combined conditions have caused our inventory (the number of total homes for sale) to go down by 1.7%. Until now, inventory has been on a steady rise. So this is quite the turnaround for our market.&nbsp;

The drop in interest rates we saw in February is another reason behind this change, as more buyers are willing to make a move now that their purchasing power has been boosted.&nbsp;

With all of these conditions in mind, sellers will be happy to know that now is a great time to make a move. **Our team just hosted a “Seven-Day Blitz” events for one of our listings that drew in 100 interested buyers on a single night.** The next day, 150 buyers showed up. We haven’t seen this level of demand in approximately two years. Sellers right now can expect to see a higher number of interested buyers checking out their listings and should anticipate multiple offers.

Buyers, meanwhile, have an incredible opportunity before them, as well. Interest rates are below 4% at the moment, which means it’s a great time to secure a loan. Market data suggests that prices are about to rise, though, so take advantage of today’s conditions while they last.
