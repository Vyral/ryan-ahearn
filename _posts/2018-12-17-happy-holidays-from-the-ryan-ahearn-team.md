December has officially arrived and the holidays are here. This is truly my favorite time of year. Instead of our usual content, today I want to take a quick moment to wish you and your loved ones happy holidays and a happy New Year. I hope that 2018 was a fantastic year for all of you, and I can only hope that 2019 is even better. Thank you for being a part of my life and the lives of my team members. We look forward to working with you next year!
