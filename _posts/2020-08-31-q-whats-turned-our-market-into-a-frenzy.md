We’ve just closed out August of 2020, and our market is on fire. We were expecting this due to the pent-up demand caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, but we were also expecting things to slow down by now, which they haven’t.&nbsp;

Let’s look at the latest year-over-year statistics from San Diego County that buyers and sellers should pay attention to if they want to forecast where the market is heading:

* The number of new listings has dropped 3% from 4,505 to 4,373
* The number of pending homes has risen 23% from 3,198 to 3,940
* Supply has dropped 45% from 7,233 to 4,004 homes
* The months of supply has dropped 45% from 2.7 to 1.5 months

As you can see, **supply is way down while demand is up, and that’s what’s driving our fast-paced market.** The reason behind this imbalance is interest rates. Last year at this time, they were between 3.6% and 3.8%. Now, they’re hovering between 2.7% and 3%—an all-time low.&nbsp;

We don’t know how long they’ll stay this low, so if you’re a buyer, I wouldn’t hesitate to buy now. Call your lender, get pre-approved, and see what your buying situation looks like. Your interest rate can either cost or save you thousands of dollars over time.&nbsp;

What can you expect if you put your home on the market now? A lot of showings, for one thing. My team and I recently listed a home that generated 36 showings in one day. Hopefully, this activity leads to multiple offers for you.&nbsp;

A lot of showings means a lot of competition for buyers, so **if you find a home you like, write an offer with strong terms,** and have your agent call the listing agent to find out exactly what the seller is looking for in an offer.&nbsp;

If you’re thinking of buying or selling or you’d like a market analysis for your neighborhood or ZIP code, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to speak with you.&nbsp;
