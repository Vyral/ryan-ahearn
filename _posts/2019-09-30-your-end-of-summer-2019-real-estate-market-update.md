Where does our San Diego County market stand as we close the book on summer and look toward fall? The number of new listings that are hitting the market has dropped by 12.6% year over year. Pending sales (or homes that have gone under contract and are now off the market) are up by 17.2%, which makes sense because if you have less inventory but a similar number of buyers, then pending sales should go up.

**So what does that do to the supply here in San Diego County?&nbsp;**

Well, at the beginning of 2019, our inventory levels were up by 25% to 30% year over year. Since then, inventory has dropped down by 17.2%, which is the biggest drop we’ve seen all year.&nbsp;

This tells us that our market should be on fire. Right now, our days on market (how long it takes for a home to sell) should be next to nothing, but they’re not. The days on market here are actually up by 14.3% over last year.

That’s a bit odd, so how do we explain it? Well, it’s taking 14% longer to sell a home, and there are 17% fewer homes on the market. In addition, we’ve noticed that buyer confidence has lowered a lot thanks to news about the stock market, the presidential election, and things like that. In addition, as prices go up, that the number of people who can afford a home goes down, so home affordability is a bit lower, as well. These factors both contribute to an increased days on market.

**What does this mean for sellers?**

If your home is on the market, don’t expect there to be the same response we’ve seen in markets with similar leading indicators in the past; you can’t just pick a price and watch your home fly off the market. You’ll need to make sure you work with the right agent with the right marketing strategy. Expect fewer offers and fewer buyers, and anticipate your home sitting on the market a little longer.

**What does this mean for buyers?**

Buyers have more time and less competition, but you also have fewer options since supply is down. All these leading indicators suggest that the market will continue to go up, just not as quickly as in the past. Homebuyers should take advantage of the fact that interest rates are really low right now—they’re still under 4% in a lot of areas. I’m taking advantage by refinancing my home to get a lower rate, and it may be a good idea for you to do so, as well.
