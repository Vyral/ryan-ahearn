Here are the top five ways to boost your curb appeal and make sure your home gives buyers a great first impression.

First, **improve your landscaping**. This is the first thing buyers see when they pull up to the curb. As a real estate agent, I don’t like pulling up to a home with a buyer client and seeing dead plants. That’s not a good look. Just buying a $2 bag of mulch from Home Depot and spreading it around your property’s perimeter will go a long way in terms of making it look cleaner. You can also add color and make things warmer and more inviting by planting some flowers.

Second, **if you have a ragged, old doormat beneath your front door, replace it with a new one.** Your entrance will look a lot better for it.&nbsp;

Next, **if you have one of those big, old-school, metal security doors, get rid of that too.** They’re not a good look for your property, and they’re liable to make buyers question the safety of your neighborhood.&nbsp;

**If you don’t have a metal security door but your front door needs work regardless, take care of that too.** If it has water stains or is faded from too much sunlight, for example, sand it down and add a fresh coat of paint. If the kick plate is damaged, replace it.&nbsp;

To take it a step further, I also recommend replacing the handle and deadbolt. Again, when I show a property, it’s not a good look when I have to struggle just to unlock the front door. That will only make the buyer suspicious that there’s other deferred maintenance required with your property.&nbsp;

Lastly, **give your garage door a makeover.** I have a five-year-old, so I know that garage doors can get damaged easily when kids are always playing in the driveway. But the garage door is the first thing buyers look at when they pull into your driveway, and any damage won’t look good.&nbsp;

Also, if you have one of those older, up-and-over garage doors, replace it with a modern one. If a buyer sees one of these older doors, they’ll think the rest of your house is old, too. I’ve made this fix for some of my clients for as little as $800, and it makes a huge difference.&nbsp;

If you’d like to know more about boosting your home’s curb appeal or you have any other real estate needs I can take care of, don’t hesitate to reach out to me. I’d love to help you.&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;
