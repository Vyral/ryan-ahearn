If you’re gearing up to buy a home, there are two things you must do before starting your home search.&nbsp;

The first is to **get pre-qualified by a mortgage lender.** This means calling up a mortgage lender (we know plenty of great ones, and we’d love to put you in touch). During this conversation, they’ll ask you questions about your job history, credit, and finances. They’ll run your credit, then ask for other documentation like pay stubs, tax returns, etc.&nbsp;

They’ll qualify you based on that information and give you an estimated dollar amount you can borrow from the bank. They’ll also estimate your monthly PITI (principal, interest, taxes, insurance) payment. This is all important because it tells you in which price range you should shop.&nbsp;

Second, **fill out our buyer questionnaire.** These questions outline important details about the home buying process (location, type of house, etc.) and help you specify your wants, needs, and non-negotiables.&nbsp;

This is especially important for homebuyer couples. If you’re buying a house with your partner, we encourage you to each fill out a questionnaire separately, compare notes, and then fill one out together. That’s the questionnaire you’ll submit back to us. This way, we can properly assimilate your wants, needs, and non-negotiables and find a house you’re *both* looking for.&nbsp;

Following these two steps ensures you’re only looking at the homes you can afford and that suit your lifestyle. The worst thing you can do is fall in love with a home only to find out you can’t afford it.&nbsp;
