We’ve made it to the fourth quarter of 2018 and it has been a great year so far. Now, we want to talk to you a little bit about our real estate market this year.

We’ve seen a ton of homes come on the market this year and more often than not, we were running into multiple-offer situations. **If you’re a homebuyer in the market right now, we want to give you some tips on how you can make your offer stand out amongst others without having to offer more money:**

**1. Know your seller.** Your agent should know who the home seller is and why they are selling. Do they need to move quickly or would they like to stay in the home a little longer after closing? Those are things your agent should know to help you make a better offer with better terms.

**2. Know your agent.** The real estate agent you hire should also be very comfortable communicating with the seller’s agent. They should have an established rapport that makes your agent stand out. That communication always needs to be open. Listing agents are always more comfortable when they’re able to actually speak with an agent in person as opposed to getting another email.

**3. Know your lender.** Once your offer is submitted, your lenders should promptly call the listing agent, letting you know how great you are as a buyer, how qualified you are, and how quickly he can make the lending process a breeze.

**4. Make a video.** People talk about submitting letters with your offer, but in a digital age where video is a useful tool, we submit videos so our buyers can communicate directly with the owner of the property. We shoot a video in front of the property with your family so that you can show the seller in person why this house is so important to you. Nobody else does this and it really sets you apart.
