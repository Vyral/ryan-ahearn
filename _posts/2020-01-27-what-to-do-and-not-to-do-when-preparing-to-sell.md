For the homeowners in our market area who are planning to sell their home, **here are four inexpensive things that you should do to improve potential buyers’ first impressions of your listing so that you can sell quickly and for the most money:**

* **Declutter and depersonalize.** You’re moving anyway; start packing up all the little stuff you have strewn around your house and store it in the garage. Be sure that all your countertops are completely clean and clear\! A decluttered home feels bigger, brighter, cleaner, and more accessible.&nbsp; Also, take down pictures of your family and other personal belongings so that the home feels neutral. Buyers who walk through your home need to be able to imagine themselves as the homeowners, not as guests.
* &nbsp;**Paint**. If your house needs new paint on the exterior, giving it a fresh coat will change the entire energy of your house, boosting your curb appeal and potential buyers’ impressions of it. Don’t miss the front door, either; a fresh coat of paint can make your front door look brand-new and improve the overall exterior aesthetic.

* **Landscaping**. Sprucing up your yard can also improve your curb appeal dramatically. Trim down overgrown bushes and trees, mow your lawn, and add plants and flowers to your yard to give it some life. You can also buy bags of bark chips from stores like Home Depot to use as mulch, which will make your landscaping look polished.
* **Eliminate odors**. If your home has any odors such as those from smoke, mildew, or dirty laundry, be sure to tackle those smells before your potential buyers arrive. Air out the home, and keep plug-in air fresheners stocked and running the whole time. People typically decide whether they like the house or not within the first 15 seconds after walking in the door; having a pleasant scent can go a long way toward giving them a positive first impression.

**If you want to sell your home for the most money you should*****avoid *****doing large-scale, expensive upgrades before consulting a real estate professional**. They can walk with you through your home and help you decide what will be most cost-effective when it comes to home improvements. A certain style of finish you like might be en vogue at the moment, but buyers in your area may not be attracted to it. Similarly, not all renovations have a high return on investment, so before you upgrade your floors, countertops and cabinets, bathrooms, or kitchens, be sure to consult a professional.
